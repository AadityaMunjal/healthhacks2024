The discolored areas usually get bigger with time. The condition can affect the skin on any part of the body. It can also affect hair and the inside of the mouth.Normally, the color of hair and skin is determined by melanin. Vitiligo occurs when cells that produce melanin die or stop functioning. Vitiligo affects people of all skin types, but it may be more noticeable in people with brown or Black skin. The condition is not life-threatening or contagious. It can be stressful or make you feel bad about yourself.Treatment for vitiligo may restore color to the affected skin. But it doesn't prevent continued loss of skin color or a recurrence.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital EditionSymptomsVitiligo signs include:
Patchy loss of skin color, which usually first appears on the hands, face, and areas around body openings and the genitals
Premature whitening or graying of the hair on your scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows or beard
Loss of color in the tissues that line the inside of the mouth and nose (mucous membranes)
Vitiligo can start at any age, but usually appears before age 30.Depending on the type of vitiligo you have, it may affect:
Nearly all skin surfaces. With this type, called universal vitiligo, the discoloration affects nearly all skin surfaces.
Many parts of the body. With this most common type, called generalized vitiligo, the discolored patches often progress similarly on corresponding body parts (symmetrically).
Only one side or part of the body. This type, called segmental vitiligo, tends to occur at a younger age, progress for a year or two, then stop.
One or only a few areas of the body. This type is called localized (focal) vitiligo.
The face and hands. With this type, called acrofacial vitiligo, the affected skin is on the face and hands, and around body openings, such as the eyes, nose and ears.
It's difficult to predict how this disease will progress. Sometimes the patches stop forming without treatment. In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of the skin. Occasionally, the skin gets its color back.When to see a doctorSee your health care provider if areas of your skin, hair or mucous membranes lose coloring. Vitiligo has no cure. But treatment might stop or slow the discoloring process and return some color to your skin.

The involved patches of skin become lighter or white. It's unclear exactly what causes these pigment cells to fail or die. It may be related to:
A disorder of the immune system (autoimmune condition)
Family history (heredity)
A trigger event, such as stress, severe sunburn or skin trauma, such as contact with a chemical
Skin layers and melanin
        Melanin is a natural pigment that gives your skin its color. It's produced in cells called melanocytes.
        Risk factorsAnyone can develop vitiligo. But you may be more likely to develop it if you:
Have a family history of the condition.
Have frequent direct contact with phenol-containing chemicals, such as those found in some detergents.
ComplicationsPeople with vitiligo may be at increased risk of:
Social or psychological distress
Sunburn
Eye problems
Hearing loss
