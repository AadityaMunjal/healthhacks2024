It causes round, firm, painless bumps ranging in size from a pinhead to a pencil eraser. If the bumps are scratched or injured, the infection can spread to nearby skin. Molluscum contagiosum also spreads through person-to-person contact and contact with infected objects.Though most common in children, molluscum contagiosum can affect adults as well — particularly those with weakened immune systems. Adults with a healthy immune system can develop molluscum contagiosum from sexual activity with an infected partner.Left untreated, the bumps usually disappear in 6 months to 2 years.Molluscum contagiosum

Skin-to-skin contact
Contact with infected objects, such as towels, kickboards and wrestling mats
Swimming in pools or hot tubs contaminated with the virus
Sexual contact with an affected partner
Scratching or rubbing the bumps, which spreads the virus to nearby skin
Risk factorsRisk factors for molluscum contagiosum include:
Being ages 1 to 10. This condition is most common in children.
Having a weakened immune system. Some conditions and treatments can weaken the immune system. Examples are leukemia, HIV and cancer treatments.
Having atopic dermatitis. The rash typical of atopic dermatitis creates an entry point for the virus that causes molluscum.
ComplicationsThe bumps and the skin around them may become inflamed. This is thought to be an immune system response to the infection. If scratched, these bumps can become infected and heal with scarring. If sores appear on the eyelids, pink eye (conjunctivitis) can develop.PreventionTo help prevent the spread of the virus:
Wash your hands. Keeping your hands clean can help prevent spreading the virus.
Avoid touching the bumps. Shaving over the infected areas also can spread the virus.
Don't share or borrow personal items. These include clothing, towels, hairbrushes and other personal items.
Avoid sexual contact. If you have molluscum contagiosum on or near your genitals, don't have sex until the bumps are treated and gone.
Cover the bumps. Cover the bumps with clothing when around others, to prevent direct contact. Leave the affected area open to the air when not around others, as this promotes healthy skin. When swimming, cover the bumps with a watertight bandage.
